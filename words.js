let pony = "Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria... …there came an era when the ideals of friendship gave way to greed, selfishness, paranoia and a jealous reaping of dwindling space and natural resources. Lands took up arms against their neighbors. The end of the world occurred much as we had predicted -- the world was plunged into an abyss of balefire and dark magic. The details are trivial and pointless. The reasons, as always, purely our own. The world was nearly wiped clean of life. A great cleansing; a magical spark struck by pony hooves quickly raged out of control. Megaspells rained from the skies. Entire lands were swallowed in flames and fell beneath the boiling oceans. Ponykind was almost extinguished, their spirits becoming part of the ambient radiation that blanketed the lands. A quiet darkness fell across the world... …But it was not, as some had predicted, the end of the world. Instead, the apocalypse was simply the prologue for another bloody chapter in pony history. In the early days, thousands were spared the horrors of the holocaust by taking refuge in enormous underground shelters known as Stables. But when they emerged, they had only the hell of the wastes to greet them. All except those in Stable Two. For on that fateful day when spellfire rained from the sky, the giant steel door of Stable Two swung closed, and never re-opened. If I’m going to tell you about the adventure of my life -- explain how I got to this place with these people, and why I did what I’m going to do next -- I should probably start by explaining a little bit about PipBucks. What is a PipBuck? A PipBuck is a device, worn on a foreleg just above the hoof, issued to every pony in a Stable when they become old enough to start work. A blending of unicorn pony magic and science, your PipBuck will keep a constant measure of your health and even help administer healing poultices and other medicine, track and organize everything in your saddlepacks, assist in repairs, and keep all manner of notes and maps available at a hooftap. Plus, it allows you to listen to the Stable broadcast whenever you would like as it can tune into and decrypt just about any radio frequency. And that’s not all. A pony’s PipBuck generates an E.F.S. (Eyes-Forward Sparkle) that will indicate direction and help gauge whether the ponies or creatures around you are hostile. And, perhaps most impressively, a PipBuck can magically aid you in a fight for brief periods of time through use of the S.A.T.S. (Stable-Tec Arcane Targeting Spell). Oh, and a feature not to be forgotten: it can keep track of the location of tagged objects or people, including the wearers of other PipBucks. So if a pony somehow got lost -- don’t ask me how you could get lost in a Stable, but it does happen on occasion -- then anypony who knew the lost pony’s tag could find them instantly. It can even be made to glow like a lamp. So yes, PipBucks really are a testament to unicorn pony arcane science. And yes, having a PipBuck is a big advantage. So with how wonderful and miraculous all that just sounded, it’s hard to impress upon ponies who never lived in a Stable just how ordinary, how pedestrian, a PipBuck was in the eyes of the ponies living in Stable Two. And why I was disappointed to have one as my cutie mark. Every pony in Stable Two had a PipBuck. All that stuff I mentioned? Most ponies don’t use even half of that. They just used it to tune into the Stable broadcast -- listened to the sweet, sweet voice of Velvet Remedy in the evenings or the latest school singing competitions during the day. The Stable had two soccer leagues, one which allowed S.A.T.S. and one which prohibited it. Otherwise, most ponies paid their PipBucks almost no attention at all. The Overmare issues each pony their own PipBuck on the day of their Cutie Mark Party -- usually a day or two after you get the mark on your flanks that tells everypony what makes you special, what you’re destined to be good at. Once it shows, the Overmare knows what work to assign you; you know your place in the Stable. So no, I was not thrilled that what made me special was something that everypony had, which was a lot like being told I wasn’t special at all. Sure, getting a PipBuck as my cutie mark could have meant I was destined to become an awesome PipBuck repair filly or something, but in reality it was like getting a cutie mark of a cutie mark. Didn’t help that I was the last pony to get her cutie mark. Not surprising in retrospect. Kinda tough to find what you’re supposed to be good at when what you’re supposed to be good at is something you don’t get until you’ve found what you’re supposed to be good at. So I tried everything. I even tried to invent new things. As a unicorn pony myself, my innate magics allow me a level of fine manipulation that earth ponies don’t enjoy. Any pony can hold a key in their teeth and open a lock, but using multiple tools in a very delicate operation? That requires precision levitation. So I decided to learn to pick locks with a bobby pin and screwdriver. And I was even getting pretty good at it. Unfortunately, it didn’t get me my cutie mark. It just got me into trouble. I even, to my humiliation, went through the C.A.T. (Cutie-mark Aptitude Test) in the hopes it would guide me to what made me special. But no. My C.A.T. was utterly average, with only marginally higher scores in a couple areas, indicating that I might be suited for work as a PipBuck Technician or a Stable Loyalty Inspector. Two options, I should note, that were even less impressive when you considered that it was generally expected that unicorn ponies would go into either technical or administrative work. That is, except the unicorn ponies who are natural artists, like Velvet Remedy. As I said before, our inherent magic allows us the sort of fine manipulation that technical work demands. Likewise, the Overmare and her government were always unicorn ponies. It is the Overmare’s unicorn magic, after all, that creates the false sunlight used to grow our underground apple orchard. And while our apples might not look like those beautiful red things in the old books, they are what keep us alive. It was only because they let me try my hooves at both positions that I gained access to a PipBuck before receiving my own, otherwise I might never have gotten my cutie mark. Oh, my name is LittlePip. Go figure. I was given the name because I was the youngest and the smallest, and even my mother had the good sense not to call me “Pipsqueak.” (Not that I don’t love her, but when a filly’s cutie mark is a glass of hard apple cider...) Anyway, funny how names like that turn out sometimes. Pleased to meet you. Here is my story… The walls of the maintenance stalls were all a very monotonous, dull grey. The particular wall I was staring at had the merit of being a very clean grey. PipBucks were notoriously hardy and reliable, so being the Stable’s PipBuck Technician meant that there were long periods of nothing to do. Being the PipBuck Technician’s apprentice meant that I was assigned all the mundane daily chores while my trainer took extended naps in the back room. Chores like cleaning the walls. “This wall needs a mural.” I let myself fantasize, picturing the Overmare agreeing and ordering Palette herself to turn our entire stall into one of her brightly colorful masterpieces. Palette was the greatest painter in Stable Two, and like every skilled artist, that made her a stable treasure. Life in Stable Two inevitably began to eat at your spirit -- you were born in the Stable, you lived your whole life in the Stable, you were going to die there, and the course of your life was largely laid out for you to see by your Cutie Mark Party. So the Overmare insisted that a new song be added to the Stable broadcast’s repertoire each week, that public areas were brightly painted and adored with uplifting and motivational murals, that regular parties were planned in the atrium… all in an effort to distract and stave off depression. Reality came crashing back as I stared at the eternally blank grey. Beautifying maintenance areas was tragically low priority already, and the PipBuck Technician stall was one of the least trafficked parts of maintenance. I felt my ears droop as I started to realize that I’d be staring at this same grey wall nearly every day for the rest of my life. “Oh dear. Is it really that bad.” And there she was. Velvet Remedy, the gorgeous charcoal-coated unicorn with streaks of color in her white mane and with a voice as smooth as silk and rich as finest chocolate, was standing in the doorway of my stall. I felt immediately grateful that I had finished the cleaning and simultaneously ashamed that the room was so beneath her. I couldn’t believe she was standing there. I’d seen her on the stage above us at late parties; I’d listened to her songs incessantly, recording every new one on my PipBuck so that I didn’t have to wait to hear it again. I’ll admit it now, I’d had a crush on Velvet Remedy for years. Me and at least three hundred other ponies. My mother used to laugh at that. “LittlePip,” she would say, chortling with her friends, “Velvet Remedy’s barn door doesn’t swing that way.” It took me a couple years to understand what my mother had meant by that. And took me several seconds to process that Velvet Remedy had just asked me something. “W-wha-huh?” Wonderful response, LittlePip. So elegant. I wanted to dig my way through the concrete floor and pull the chunks over the top of me. She smiled sweetly. She smiled at me! And in that amazing voice, “You looked so heartbroken when I came in. Is there anything I can do?” Velvet Remedy offered. To help. Me. I was shocked back to my senses. Velvet Remedy must have some reason to be down here. Some PipBuck reason. It wasn’t like she would just go wandering around maintenance, after all. Looking around, I realized that I was the only pony on duty. My teacher was, as usual, asleep in his office. “Oh… no, it was n-nothing.” I tried to regain composure. “How may I be of assistance?” Velvet Remedy’s expression was both compassionate and unconvinced, but she lifted a forehoof, raising her PipBuck up to my gaze. A more elegant model than mine, with her initials and cutie mark (a beautiful bird with wings outstretched and beak opened in song) embellishing it tastefully. “I hate to be a bother, but it’s begun to chafe. Could you replace the padding?” “Oh, absolutely!” I was already levitating the special keys used to unlock a PipBuck from a pony’s foreleg (as an apprentice PipBuck Technician, I had all manner of special precision tools in the pockets of my utility barding). “I’ll have it done in right quick!” The PipBuck came off with a click. Velvet Remedy chuckled hesitantly, lowering her hoof. “Oh no, that’s all right. Take your time. I’m going to put some salve on this leg back in my room and rest up for the afternoon.” That’s right! Velvet Remedy was performing at the Stable Two Saloon tomorrow night! I would have to polish it up, make it worthy of being worn above her hoof. If I spent all night on it, I could give it a full tune-up, have it running as smoothly as the day she got it, and still have it back to her before the show. “All right! I’ll have it back to you by this time tomorrow. You won’t be disappointed. I promise!” She smiled at me again, and all the grey in the world couldn’t darken my day. “Thank you.” And then she turned to go. I watched as her cutie mark disappeared around the doorway. Then she was gone. The next day, I was whistling one of Velvet Remedy’s songs as I walked down the halls towards her room. Her PipBuck was hovering along beside me in a field of magical levitation, freshly padded with the best lining I could find, looking shiny and new. I was tired from a long night or work, but in high spirits. Velvet Remedy was going to be so happy with my work! Turning the corner, I was startled out of my reverie by the mass of ponies gathered outside Velvet Remedy’s room. Damn, I was going to have to battle my way through hoof-print seekers and paparazzi. Levitating the PipBuck higher, I started to shove my way into the crowd. “She’s gone!” “How could she leave?” The hushed voices and panicked whinnies around me grew alarming. “Why would she abandon us?” Gone? Velvet Remedy was… gone? And then the words that stopped me cold. “I didn’t think the Stable door even could open!” She was gone outside?!? “Don’t worry, everypony!” boomed the voice of the Overmare from somewhere in the crowd. “I have the tag of each and every pony in the Stable. I will personally send out a rescue party. We’ll have our Velvet back by the end of the day. Worry not.” I felt I was drowning in cold, wet cement. My gaze slowly moved up towards the PipBuck floating above me. I lowered my head, slowly trying to back out of the crowd, curling the floating PipBuck close. When the Overmare brought up Velvet Remedy’s tag, it would lead everypony not to Velvet but to her PipBuck sitting in the maintenance… With a thump, I backed into somepony, startling me enough that the levitation field evaporated in a poof and the clean and shiny PipBuck clattered to the floor. Turning, I found myself eye-to-eye with the Overmare. She didn’t speak, her gaze turning to the PipBuck on the ground. Velvet Remedy’s initials and cutie mark clearly visible. “What. Is. This?” The Overmare spoke slowly, dangerously. All eyes turned to me. I could feel every pair of eyes. Nobody spoke. The silence bore down like a lead blanket. My mouth went dry. I couldn’t find my voice. I didn’t need to. I could feel the wave of loathing. Dozens of Velvet Remedy fanponies, and I was the pony holding the reason why their idol was lost to them. The Overmare’s voice was low and surprisingly gentle. “Take it and go to your room. Swiftly.” She didn’t need to tell me twice. I lay on my bed that evening, poking at Velvet Remedy’s PipBuck as the radio in my own played yet another re-iteration of the tragedy of the day. I couldn’t believe it. Velvet Remedy was gone. I couldn’t understand. How could she leave? Why would she go? The door out of Stable Two was closed and sealed. Only the Overmare knew the secrets to opening it, assuming it even could open. Which, obviously, it could. But why? Nobody really knew what was outside, if there was anything out there at all. Historical books suggested the world outside was blasted, lifeless and poisonous. That was, at least, the common and logical assumption. But a ghost story somepony told at my first (and only) slumber party had given me horrible nightmares and still lurked in the shadows of my head: a tale of a pony who somehow got the Stable door open and stepped outside… only to find out that there was no outside! Just a great nothingness that whisked the pony away, devouring her soul so that she was nothingness too. Empirically, I knew that wasn’t the case, but the mental image still haunted me. The two things I did understand was that Velvet Remedy had gotten me to remove her PipBuck so the Overmare couldn’t track her with it, and that I was screwed. Being the smallest pony my age, and the last to get my cutie mark, did not facilitate building friendships with my peer ponies. Mother honestly didn’t help either. Nor did waking up screaming at my first slumber party. So I was used to being alone. But I’d never had enemies before. I’d been beneath the notice of other ponies, but I’d never had one hate me. I really couldn’t blame them either, even though it totally wasn’t fair. They were upset and hurt and needed a scapegoat. The news hadn’t mentioned me by name, just “Velvet Remedy’s custom-decorated PipBuck was found in the possession of a PipBuck Technician pony”, but with a whole two of us, it wasn’t hard for everypony to figure out, even without the scene outside her room earlier. The Overmare was speaking on the radio. “We are all feeling this loss. But I want to remind everypony that Velvet Remedy chose to do this. She chose to leave her home. To abandon us, her family. She betrayed my trust and she betrayed yours, just as she betrayed the trust of the pony who she tricked into removing her PipBuck, ensuring we could not find her. I know many of you are angry or hurt. I urge you to direct that anger where it truly belongs…” As thankful as I was for her words, it wasn’t going to change the resentment that I would face every day, even if every pony kept it to themselves. It hung in the air like old smoke. I distracted myself with the errant PipBuck, taking note of an encrypted file. I had spotted it yesterday, figuring it was probably an unfinished new song. I didn’t want to open it then, both out of respect for Velvet Remedy’s privacy and a dislike of spoilers, but I guessed it didn’t matter anymore. The song would never be played. Opening a pouch on my utility barding, I withdrew an access tool that would allow me to remove the encryption safely and easily. It was a sound file. I played it. “The override code for opening the door to Stable Two is… CMC3BFF.” I shot up in surprise at what I had heard. Swiftly, I turned off the radio and played it again. I didn’t recognize the voice. It was female, kinda sweet, and had a strange accent that didn’t sound like anyone in the Stable. But now I knew how Velvet Remedy left. I must have sat there for hours, contemplating what I should do. But finally, I made my choice. I was going to go outside after her. I was going to bring her back. I stood there, staring at the huge steel door that sealed Stable Two away from the horrors (or nothingness!) outside. And at the two guard ponies who blocked my way. I had my saddlebags packed with apples and necessities. Even a Big Book of Arcane Sciences for something to read. I had two canteens around my neck. I was ready to go. But the Overmare was making sure there were no follow-up acts. Insistence and glowering looks weren’t getting me anywhere. My horn was glowing, but they stood their ground, unimpressed. They weren’t going to let me anywhere near the control panel. “Hey, aren’t you the filly who let our Velvet get lost outside anyway?” one of the guards inquired daringly, taking a bullying step forward. The other guard looked away in disgust. I’m not sure if he was disgusted at me, or if he felt like the Overmare seemed to about ponies wanting to take it out on me. I was kinda hoping it was the former, considering what I was about to do to them. THUD! The metal footlocker above them dropped onto their heads, knocking both out cold. Earth ponies -- they never see that levitating-something-up-behind-you trick coming. I was at the controls, entering the passcode from Velvet Remedy’s PipBuck when the Overmare’s voice boomed through nearby speakers. “Stop! I order you to stop this instant!” Yeah, that wasn’t going to happen. “Guards! I want every guard pony at Stable Two door! Stop that filly!” Oh crap! My hooves flew up to the main switch for the door, and I prayed to Celestia that the code worked. Then, with all my strength, I threw the switch. A loud clanging filled the air, followed by a hissing of steam and a great rumble that shook the room. As I watched, the massive bolt that held the door from Stable Two shut slid back. A huge hinge-arm swung down, attaching itself to the door, and with a teeth-hurting squeal, pulled the massive steel door out and away. Randomly, I found myself thinking in my mother’s voice “Stable Two’s barn door doesn’t swing that way.” The door to Stable Two wasn’t supposed to swing at all. Even though I threw the switch, I was stunned to see it actually open. “You don’t have to do this… LittlePip, isn’t it?” The Overmare’s voice kicked me out of my stupor. I could hear the hooves of galloping guards drawing near. I took a step towards the door. “Don’t worry. I’ll bring her back.” “No you won’t! If you leave here, you’ll never be let back in!” For a moment, the unfairness stung. The Overmare was willing to send out a search party to bring Velvet Remedy back. But then, Velvet was special, and I was… not. Part of me wanted to turn back right there, crawl back to my room and my dreary but safe life. Drawing myself up, I stepped out the door. With a final hiss and clang, the steel door of Stable Two closed irrevocability behind me. I don’t know what I expected to find just beyond the door, but it certainly wasn’t this long, dark hallway that smelled of rotting timbers and sepulcher air. I was no longer in the Stable. But I wasn’t outside yet either. I was in limbo. I turned on my PipBuck’s light, and recoiled with a gasp at the skeletons of long-dead ponies which littered the hall. The outside of the Stable door was marred from where ponies had slammed on it until their hooves cracked and shattered, trying to get in. Moving forward quickly, I discovered that the hallway opened into an old room with stairs leading up to a horizontal door with a shattered lock. The entrance from the outside world into Stable Two had been cleverly disguised as the door to a humble apple cellar. And by disguised, I meant that the person who built it had been building an apple cellar. Taking a deep breath, I trotted up the stairs, swung open the cellar door, and stepped outside. Nothingness! My first several seconds outside were a heart-bursting eternity of hoof-pounding terror! The story had been right! All that was outside was a great black nothingness! It surrounded me, suffocating. If I had been able to draw breath, I would have screamed. And then my eyes started to adjust to the darkness. I began to calm, gasping, feeling weak (and not just a little foolish). In my defense, I had never experienced night before. Not really. Sure, I’d always turned off the lights before curling into bed, but that darkness was small, confined to my little room. And there was always the glow from under the door. The hall lights of Stable Two were eternal. This was different. A cool air, quite unlike anything within the Stable, tickled my coat and chilled my skin beneath. It bore smells that were dank and rotting, dusty and alien. I could hear the sounds of night insects, creaking of wood and a far-off sloshing... but I was struck more by what I couldn’t hear -- the constant low hum of the Stable’s generators and the ever-present high whine of the lights were gone -- so powerful in their absence that I first mistook the outside as silent. I could feel dirt and broken stone beneath my hooves, so unlike the smooth and sterile floors I had trotted all my life. And though I could not see much or far, I could see further than I had ever seen before, and there were no walls to mark the end of the room. I was staring into a horizontal abyss that stretched out from me in every direction. An entirely new panic began to form within me. My hind legs went out from under me and I sat, stunned. I turned my gaze to the ground, breathing deeply, thanking it not only for holding me up, but being a visual endpoint. Then I made the mistake of looking up into the sky, and the absolute endless up-ness of it sent my head spinning and my stomach lurching. Great masses of clouds rolled over most of the sky; but there were gaps through which soft light poured and through those I could see the up went on forever. Insanely, I thought of the clouds as a great net, made to catch me if I fell from the earth into the yawning gulf above; but if I slipped through the holes, I would just fall up forever. I clenched my eyes shut and tried to keep from vomiting. The fear and queasiness was intense but passing. Once my faculties returned, I began to notice those things that had escaped me in my initial panic. The surrounding terrain was becoming evident. The world around me did not stretch out evenly; the ground heaved and rolled -- hills creeping towards mountains. The earth was punctured by the upthrusting black fingers of long-dead trees. Along distant hilltops, I could see the swaying, leaf-shrouded branches of healthier woods, but the living trees near Stable Two were few, scattered and sickly. Second, I noticed that my PipBuck was flashing with a host of alerts. The map-maker was already beginning to do its work on my new and unfamiliar surroundings, and to my surprise had already pulled a label from the ether: Sweet Apple Acres. Turning around to get my bearings, my eyes were drawn to the large, hollowed husk of what I assumed had once been a magnificent house. Now, it creaked and swayed in the breeze as if threatening to collapse. Looking to my PipBuck again, I noticed that it was picking up several radio transmissions. The radio broadcast from Stable Two was dark, but new stations had taken its place. My heart leapt, for it was the first indication that there might be pony life out here after all. I nudge my PipBuck to start playing the first station on the list. “...still sealed up. There is no way inside. My son, he ate one of the apples from those damned apple trees up near the Stable, and now he’s terribly sick. Too sick to move. We’ve holed up in the cistern near the old memorial. We’re running out of food and medical supplies. Please, if anypony hears this, help us... Message repeats. Hello? Is there anypony out there? Please, we need help! I was bringing my family to the Stable up near Sweet Apple Acres when we were attacked by raiders. Only my son and I survived. We made it to the Stable, but it’s still sealed up. There is no way inside. My son, he ate one of the apples from those damned apple trees up near the Stable, and now he’s terribly sick. Too sick to move. We’ve holed up in the cistern near the old memorial. We’re running out of food and medical supplies. Please, if anypony hears this, help us... Message repeats. Hello?...” A voice was filled with a terrible resignation, as if the pony had already given up hope and was just going through the motions. Shaken, I turned it off. I didn’t think I could bear to hear it again. That is when I noticed the soft ticking from my PipBuck. Checking it over, I discovered that its radiation detector -- a feature I had never known to be used, had self-activated. The cute little rainbow dial had always been planted firmly in the green. It was still there, but edging discreetly towards the yellow. I couldn’t just stand here beside what had long, long ago been the door to a simple apple cellar for the rest of my life. Well, I could, but it would be a relatively short and miserable life. A realization was dawning on me: with so many directions to go, what was the likelihood that I would chose the path that Velvet Remedy had followed? Even though she only had a few hours head start, the prospect of finding her was bleak. But I had to start somewhere. And the best chance I had was to get up high and have a look around. The ruins near me rose higher than any of the nearby trees, and the sheered-off roof of its upper tower was probably the best vantage point I could hope for. I closed my eyes, steadied myself, and went inside. What was left of the Sweet Apple Acres building proved sturdier than it looked (or sounded). It was also almost barren, anything of value that had survived had been looted, leaving only scraps that nobody wanted but that time itself seemed unable to erase. Rusted shoes, boxes of soaps for cleaning dresses that no longer existed, a pitchfork with a shattered handle, a rake. I began up the stairs. My eyes were alerted to a feeble glow, the soft green color of a poisoned apple, bathing the room above. The glow came from the screen of an old terminal, a device of arcane science identical to the ones used throughout Stable Two. It seemed miraculous that it still worked after centuries on the outside. When Stable-Tec built something, they built it to last. Curiosity lured me to it, and my wonder was quickly replaced with understanding. It was no coincidence that this particular terminal was live, for on it was a fresh message: To any pony who has left Stable Two in search of me: Please, go home. I am doing what I have to do. The Overmare understands, even if she can never agree, and I hope one day you will to. I will not be back. Do not look for me. Do not endanger yourself further for my sake. Please forgive me. Velvet Remedy I searched the terminal for more, but all the other messages were ancient and corrupted save for one. And that one had a rather unique encryption, something I had heard of but never seen before -- a binary encryption such that in order to decrypt it, I would first have to download the message into my PipBuck from both the terminal which had been used to send it and the one upon which it was received. Having nothing better to do with the vast amounts of storage my PipBuck was capable of, I downloaded it. In reality, I knew that the chances that I would ever come across the companion terminal, much less that it would be functional, were overwhelmingly against me. Nor did I have any reason to believe a message centuries old would be of any significance. More importantly, I now had to face that outside was my new home. Even if I found Velvet Remedy, it was unlikely that she would accompany me back. I’ll admit, I had been subtly entertaining a fantasy where the Overmare would be so delighted with Velvet’s return that she would embrace us both back into the herd. Maybe even throw me a party. Now, I was forced to admit how foalish that vision was. Thinking upon this made my head fill with black clouds. But as I reached the top of the ruins and looked out over the wasteland, a bright light, feeble as it was, flickered in that darkness... just as the light from the campfire, not half an hour’s trot distant, poked an orange hole in the night. As I approached the circle of firelight, I knew something was off. Something about the way the dusty beige unicorn was laying on his mat of straw, legs curled up under him. Some tenseness in his body language. But it wasn’t until I stepped hoof into the light and got a good look -- a warm “Hello” dying on my lips -- that I saw he was gagged, and caught the glint of the flames against a few expose links in the chains binding his hooves. “Well lookee here! Walked up all nice and pleasant, didn’t she?” A large earth pony emerged from the shadows of a nearby rock. His hooves clacked metallically against the rocky ground, shod in cruelly spiked ponyshoes. Two more ponies slid out of hiding on opposite sides -- one another earth pony holding a shovel whose blade had been lethally sharpened, the other a unicorn whose glowing horn levitated towards me a short instrument of wood and metal with two barrels. Each pony wore barding made from thick hide. Much like night, I had never seen a firearm before, save for pictures in books. But those books were more than explicit enough for me to recognize the mortal threat. The bound unicorn on the mat shook his head with a sad yet derisive look and began trying the scrape the gag away with a forehoof, no longer making effort to keep the chains secret. The three ponies menacing me spared him only the occasional glance. “Might as well have trussed herself up for us,” the gun-wielding unicorn snickered. Then, addressing me, “You wouldn’t mind, would you?” Laughter. “And another unicorn too. She’ll fetch a pretty price, this one.” Fetch a price for what? And from whom? The one holding the shovel-spear in his mouth mumbled something incomprehensible. Then, apparently deciding the gun was sufficient deterrent, spat out his weapon and re-iterated, “By the Go... I mean, look at her! I think she’s taken a bath!” I was suddenly and bizarrely aware of how filthy all four of the ponies were, and how foul they smelled. I managed to cover a gag with a sneeze. “What’s going on?” I asked. Of the emotions battling for supremacy in my head, confusion had clawed its way to victory. The captive unicorn finally succeeded in pulling the filthy gag free. “They’re slavers, you idiot.” Monterey Jack, the dirty beige unicorn with dour expression and a cutie mark that looked like cheese, followed behind me as we trudged alongside our captors, walking a broken path that once was a road. My legs were in chains, making walking difficult and anything more speedy than a trot impossible. My PipBuck had stymied the slavers efforts to bind my forelegs, eventually forcing them to chain me above the knees. Had the one with the shovel-spear not been holding its point dangerously against my throat, the other two would have gotten a few hooves to tender places for their efforts. As it was, they made short work of me. I was not gagged, but Monterey had convinced me early that unnecessary chatter from the slaves-to-be would likely result in the loss of my tongue. Not that I had much to say to these brutes anyway aside from my repertoire of colorful metaphors. I didn’t expect they would answer my questions, even if my tongue should survive the asking, and they were being chatty enough with each other to suffice. “Hate thef fart,” grumbled the earth pony through the spear clenched in his teeth. “Well then, if you would just learn to swim, we could take the long way, couldn’t we?” suggested the unicorn with poisoned sweetness. “Hate fuffen sweffey.” By his smell, decidedly more pungent than the others, I guessed he just hated water in general. “How about you stop complaining and I’ll let you sample one of the slaves before we get to the forest.” Their leader, the earth pony named Cracker with the spiked shoes and a cutie mark that looked suspiciously like a whip (or maybe a snake?), turned back towards Monterey and I with a filthy smile. I looked away. They laughed. Through their disgusting dialogue, I could hear a liquid sound ahead. Not like a burbling water fountain but closer to a sloughing muck. And... something else. A distant sound, getting closer. Music? Yes, music. Slightly tinny yet... triumphant? Regal? I couldn’t put my hoof on exactly what feeling the music was trying to inspire, but it was brightly out-of-place. Cracker took note of my expression and smirked. “You look like you’ve never heard that before. What, did you live your life in a Stable? If you’re hoping for the cavalry, that ain’t it filly. That’s just one of those sprite-bots.” The music cut out with a sharp twang. The unicorn slaver, Sawed-Off, trotted ahead a bit, peering down the path ahead. Turning back to the rest of us, he smirked. “Think one of the radigators got it?” Cracker suggested it flew into somepony’s booby trap. The other earth pony suggested a mouthful of spear-mangled mumbling. The unicorn turned forward again and the glow from his horn illuminated the machine -- a metal ball about the size of a foal’s head floating on four silently flapping wings – hovering silently right in front of his face. No arcane science this, I could tell; it was pure earth pony engineering. “FUCK!” Sawed-Off leapt back a full pony’s length in surprise. Then swung his shotgun to bear and fired it at the sprite-bot. The sound was like a metal plate falling from the ceiling, and it echoed through the night-darkened hills. Sparks specked the metal ball as it was peppered with scattershot. It let out an electric whine and darted into the darkness. The unicorn almost took off after it, but Cracker’s voice cut the distance between them, “That’s enough, Sawed-Off. Save your ammo.” “Dammit, I hate when they pull that stealthy shit. It’s a flying fucking radio; it’s not supposed to sneak up on ponies.” My ears were burning from the free flow of crude profanity, but I didn’t mind. I was mulling over what I had just seen. “Idiot,” muttered Monterey Jack under his breath. “They heard that all the way in Ponyville...” Unlike my fellow slave, I was pleased to have witnessed the unicorn firing off his weapon. Because now I knew how it worked. “...What kind of damned fool,” Monterey grumbled, “announces his presence this close to raider territory.” A river slithered across our path, its waters slipping and oozing along its banks, half-stagnant. The water lapped and sucked at the supports of a bridge, making the wet sounds I had been hearing. Beyond the bridge lurked the shattered remains of a pre-war town. The bridge was a maze of barricades. Dark shadows of ponies moved about it. Briefly I may have made the mistake of hoping for rescue; but my eyes were drawn to the spiked poles that lined the bridge, and the still rotting heads of decapitated ponies that adorned two of them. I tasted bile. The sight was horrific. “Cager, stay here,” Cracker said, finally putting a name to the spear-wielding slaver pony. “Sawed-Off, let’s go hear what the toll is this time.” Monterey Jack lowered his head and looked balefully towards the bridge. I moved closer to him, following his example, and hoping that I had positioned myself so Cager couldn’t see the faint glow from my horn as I slipped my screwdriver and a bobby pin from my stable utility barding. Like all of the slavers’ equipment, the manacles on my legs were crude and of low quality. As Cracker and Sawed-Off argued with the bridge ponies, I focused on picking the first lock. I was rewarded with a soft click as it sprung open, releasing my PipBuck foreleg. The manacle fell to the ground with a little thump. “Hhu!” Cagey’s ears had shot up, and now he moved around to see me. Swiftly, I cut the magic, dropping the screwdriver and bobby pin into the dirt, and hoped that in the darkness the slaver couldn’t see the change in my chains. “Wuf hoo uf foo?” Cagey growled dangerously. The nasty sharp edge of the shovel hovered inches from my eyes. BLAM! Cagey turned abruptly, the spear-shovel slashing close enough to my face that I shrieked. The gunshot was from the bridge. It didn’t sound like Sawed-Off’s shotgun. But the second shot did. It took Cagey a breath to recognize that crossing the bridge had become a bloody affair. Glowering back at us, his posture threatening, he started to say... something. I suspect he was warning us to stay put, but I’ll never know. His head exploded, showering me with gore. I stood there, eyes wide, shaking with shock. Blood, warm and sticky, ran down my forehead and into my left eye, oozed into my coat and mane. In the growing list of things I’d not seen before this night, the death of another pony ranked at the top. I blinked, feeling the blood on my eyelid. Cagey was dead! And I had Cagey all over me!! The urge to throw myself into the river was overwhelming. But I wouldn’t get to it like this. Pushed by something more than determination now, my horn once again glowed and I and began to unlock the rest of my manacles. I spared a glance towards the bridge, seeing Sawed-Off hunkering down beside one of the barricades as he magically pulled his shotgun open, stuffing in more ammo. Two shots, I realized. One at the sprite-bot, one just now. Two shots, and then reload. Closing the weapon, he levitated it up above the barricade and shot blindly into the violent milieu, spraying an already wounded raider pony with scattershot. The pony staggered and fell. Unfortunately for Sawed-Off, the raider behind him had a different kind of shotgun, one that was faster and not limited to two shots, that fired slugs which tore great holes in the unicorn slaver’s body the moment he looked up to see the results of his effort. I turned away, cringing from the nightmare playing out before me. I focused on the locks. I had freed myself and was beginning to free Monterey when two raider ponies trotted off the bridge towards us, stepping over the battle-mutilated corpses of Cracker, Sawed-Off and the raiders they had taken down with them. One of those approaching was the unicorn raider wielding the devastating combat shotgun. The other, an earth pony with a sledgehammer in its teeth. The unicorn was laughing. Not the mean laugh of Cracker, but a crazed laugh that sent chills down the back of my neck. “Looks like we got ourselves some prizes!” The earth pony chortled behind the sledgehammer as the unicorn looked us over appraisingly. The two were somehow even filthier than the slavers. The unicorn bore jagged scars across her face and flanks, one of them tearing through her cutie mark, several freshly bleeding. The earth pony was hairless and painfully burned over much of her left side. Both wore barding that looked ragged and cobbled together. “help us?” I suggested weakly. “Oh, I’ll help myself to you, all right!” The unicorn reared up and gave me a kick, her hoof striking hard into my side. Pain exploded and I dropped, gasping. Rearing up again, she brought her full weight down on me. I howled. Near me, Monterey let out a wet grunt of pain as the earth pony gave him a taste of her sledgehammer. Leaving me in a crying huddle, the unicorn also turned her attention to the still-chained Monterey. In moments it became clear they intended to beat and bludgeon him until he was another lifeless corpse. And probably not stop then. “Hold his leg out. I’m gonna shoot his hooves off!” The unicorn raider floated the combat shotgun a foot from Monterey’s splayed left hindleg, the only one I had freed from its manacle. Ignoring the pain, I leapt up, closing the distance and spinning as I gave a fierce back-kick. My hooves connected with the shotgun, sending it flying. It clattered onto the bridge beyond. A moment later, I was levitating the shovel-spear at the two raider ponies who stood facing me with gleeful expressions. Two against one, and both of them were experienced fighters. The one with the sledgehammer stepped closer, as if eager to see if hammer beat knife. Monterey was on her in an instant, throwing his forelegs over her head, pulling the chain between them across her neck. The sledgehammer fell from her mouth as the raider pony choked. The unicorn turned, surprised by the sudden change in odds. I could have attacked her then, but threatening a pony is much different than actually attacking one. I wasn’t sure I had it in me to slash at another pony, to draw her blood. To maim, or possibly kill. The unicorn kicked up the fallen sledgehammer and turned to face me with it, murder in her eyes. And suddenly, I found it easy to thrust the shovel-spear forward. I was no longer struggling with following through on a threat; this was survival. Self-preservation is instinctual; it clears away the moral hesitations. And while I did not have the fighting skills of my opponent, I did have an advantage all my own. S.A.T.S. Aided by the targeting spell of my PipBuck, I sent the spear slashing across her knees, hobbling her. A second slash, this time across her face, relieved her of her weapon. The third would be a killing blow... ...except I wasn’t ready to do that. Not yet. Instead, I swung the spear around, cracking her across the head with its handle, hard enough to splinter the wood. The unicorn raider fell at my feet, unconscious. I looked up. Monterey was standing, chest heaving, over the body of the earth pony raider, the life choked out of her. He was staring at me quietly. Then finally raised a forehoof, only for the chain to clank tight before he had it more than a few inches off the ground. “Oh!” Dropping the shovel-spear, I turned on the light of my PipBuck and searched about for my screwdriver. I had lost the bobby pin; there was no chance of finding it in the dirt at night. But I had more. Once we were both free, Monterey limped slowly over to the bridge. A moment later, he returned, his horn glowing a gentle beige. Sawed-Off’s shotgun followed him. Before I could react, he aimed it at the head of the unconscious unicorn raider and fired. Her blood began to seep across the ground towards my hooves. I watched in stunned silence as he turned and began prodding at the bodies, tugging items from them. Finally, I found my voice. “What are you doing?” He looked at me as if I was stupid. “Checking to see if they have anything valuable on them. With luck, food.” I nodded, watching him move to the bodies at this end of the bridge. Looting the bodies of the dead felt wrong; but a cold, rational part of me murmured that it was a qualm I would have to get over in order to survive. And imagine how embarrassed I'd be if I starved to death out here because I'd been too shy to check a dead pony's bag for a pouch of oats or a can of old applesauce? I moved a bit further down the bridge. I looked over the body of a dead raider pony, his face bloody and torn from Cracker’s ponyshoes. I started to go through the pockets of his barding, but my stomach rebelled, and I flung myself to the railing, heaving my lunch into the foul river below. A large break in the clouds brought a soft and silvery light to everything, and I could see my reflection in the water, still covered with Cagey’s drying blood. Then I saw Sawed-Off’s shotgun hovering in the air behind my head. “I’ll be taking what you have too,” Monterey Jack informed me with a bored drawl. “w-What?” I turned slowly to see him standing on the bridge, bathed in moonlight, his horn glowing a soft beige light. The shotgun floated between is, pointed at me. “b-But I just saved you!” “Yeah. And for that, I’m not going to kill you.” His eyes narrowed. “Unless, of course, you do something stupid right now.” “But I just saved you!” “Aren’t you top of your class,” he said snidely. “We should work together! Travel together!” Monterey snorted. “And split our limited provisions? Go to sleep with one eye open each night, hoping to catch you when you try to stab me in the back. No thanks.” My righteous disbelief stopped short of denial. Suddenly, I was so very weary. Nodding, I lowered my head and let my two canteens slip free. I then backed up so he could approach them. I turned my head to start unclasping my saddle bags. I saw it on the bridge just beyond my tail. Turning back to Monterey, my own horn was glowing. And the combat shotgun whipped into the air. For a long moment, we stood there, two unicorn ponies on a bridge, surrounded by bodies, shotguns floating between us, aimed at each other. Moonlight shone down on us from the break in the clouds. Monterey Jack broke the silence, “You’re not going to use that. I saw you spare that raider. If you couldn’t kill a pony like that, you don’t have it in you to kill me.” I narrowed my eyes. “I’m a quick study.” He huffed, but didn’t move. “Do you even know how to use that thing?” I forced a smile across my face. “Do you know that you only have one shot left? And judging by the sprite-bot, that gun is in such poor repair I’ll survive being shot with it. Will you survive being shot with this as many times as I can move the trigger while you try to reload?” Monterey Jack took a step back. And with that falter, my smile was no longer forced. “And I’ll be taking my canteens back.” Ponyville. I wondered just how my PipBuck knew the names of places before I did. It even named the wreckage of a building that I had just slipped into. Ponyville was raider territory. I just hoped this place, this “Carousel Boutique”, was not crawling with them. Monterey Jack and I had barely parted ways when the railing of the bridge exploded next to me. A sniper! The same pony, I presumed, who had turned Cagey’s head to applesauce. I fled into the town, keeping to what cover there was. Few of the buildings were intact enough to hide in. This was the closest. Fortunately, I was alone. I waited for nearly an hour, curled up in a shadow near the door; but the sniper pony seemed uninspired to follow me. No, she or he could just wait until I came out. Fatigue washed over me. I had stayed up all the night before, and this night’s events were a strain on both body and spirit. My muscles were weak and achy. My body hurt from the kicks I had taken. I felt emotionally played-out. I needed to sleep. Sleeping here was probably a horrible idea. If I woke up at all, it could be in the hooves of slavers, raiders or possibly worse. But going back outside, finding someplace better, it just wasn’t on the table. I was in no shape to test my wits against the sniper pony again. Carousel Boutique was quite similar in condition to the building up at Sweet Apple Acres, only the looting was more destructive. The walls had been painted with crude images of violence and cruder swear words. A pile of torn-up cloth rotted in a corner, smelling foul, like ponies had urinated on it repeatedly. There were two beds, one of which was stained deeply with blood (and probably more vile things). The other was smaller, a foal’s bed, nothing but a mattress on a crushed frame. In my state, I felt it would do wonderfully. The Carousel Boutique offered two more treasures, a locked chest and another terminal, identical to the one at Sweet Apple Acres. This one too was still functional, again to my surprise. It was locked; slipping out my access tool, I went to work. These terminals were crafted by some of the same ponies who later made the PipBucks, and the encryptions and locks were similar enough that my tools allowed me to get partway through the security. What remained was a puzzle, finding the password within strands of code that my access tool laid bare. In my fried mental state, it was probably a small miracle that I was able to parse the code and find the password. Or possibly not. The password was “apple”. I laughed aloud, catching myself when I heard the volume of my own voice in the stillness of the decrepit boutique, as I realized that, beyond all realistic chance, this was the computer that the message had been sent to. With an unwarranted feeling of accomplishment, I downloaded it, and let my PipBuck do the rest. Age had damaged the recording, but there was enough audible for me to recognize that same female voice, kinda sweet and with an odd accent, that had many hours before revealed to me the code that lead me out of my old life and into this new and horrible one. “...special instructions for Stable Two... ...that’s muh family down there! Until the poison is gone from up here, that door doesn’t open for anypony!” The voice faded in and out of static. “...know you hate this, Sweetie Belle, but you’re an Overmare now. The Overmare of the most important Stable in all of Equestria. I need you to do this for me... ...to keep them safe... ...best friends forever, remember?...” The sound file died with a whimper. I had been right -- there was really no value in a two-century old message. I left the chest for the morning, curled up, and went to sleep."

let para = "TITLE SEQUENCE OVER BLACK Accompanied by dark but curiously upbeat MUSIC. At the end of the credits, the MAIN TITLE, in strange calligraphy, fills the screen -- “PARASITE” MUSIC FADES. INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - DAY A dank semi-basement apartment. KI-WOO, 24, runs from corner to corner searching desperately for a Wi-Fi signal. Various networks pop up, but they’re all password-protected. KI-WOO NO. Not you too “iptime.” Ki-Jung! Upstairs neighbor finally locked up his Wi-Fi. ADJACENT ROOM -- Lying on the floor of the narrow room, KI-JUNG, 23, barely moves her lips -- ‘Fuck.’ KI-JUNG Try ‘123456789.’ Then try it backwards. KI-WOO No luck. ANOTHER ROOM -- Also lying on the floor, CHUNG-SOOK, 49, the mother, scoffs at their collective misery. CHUNG-SOOK What am I supposed to do if someone calls me? What if it’s a job? Hey, Ki-Tek! She kicks KI-TEK, 49, who is sleeping at her feet. CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D) I know you’re awake, asshole. Care to comment? KI-TEK (wiping his drool) What?  CHUNG-SOOK Our phones have been suspended for weeks, and now the neighbors have shut us out. What’s your plan? She kicks him again. CHUNG-SOOK (CONT’D) What are you going to do about it? What’s the plan, genius? She treats Ki-Tek like shit, but it doesn’t bother him. He rises with the most serene, enlightened smile, then plods over to the -- LIVING ROOM SLASH KITCHEN Where he removes a bag of white bread from the sad, empty fridge. The bread is nearly gone too. Only the ends remain. Ki-Tek takes a piece and picks off the moldy parts. He chews on the bread as he watches his son’s Wi-Fi dance. KI-TEK Son, if one seeks Wi-Fi-- He raises his hand high. KI-TEK (CONT’D) One must reach into the heavens. Up. KI-WOO Yes, Father. Ki-Woo raises the phone high as he heads into the -- BATHROOM The bathroom is long and narrow and has a raised ‘altar’ at the far end where the toilet sits. The odd placement is necessitated by the semi-basement’s lower position in relation to the septic tank. Ki-Woo walks in and climbs onto the toilet seat. He continues to fish for a signal when -- KI-WOO (CONT’D) BOOYAH! KI-JUNG (O.S.) You got it? Ki-Jung barges in and walks over with her phone held up. 2. 3 3 KI-WOO You see it? “coffeenara_2G”. I guess it’s a new coffee joint. Must be nearby. KI-JUNG I’m not getting shit. KI-WOO Get up closer. Ki-Jung climbs onto the altar and squeezes next to Ki-Woo. The siblings look ridiculous. Head touching the ceiling. Huddled on top of the toilet seat. Chung-Sook pops in. CHUNG-SOOK No text from Pizza Time? 2,000 more boxes and it’s payday. INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LATER The family sits among piles of UNASSEMBLED PIZZA BOXES and folds them in silence. The crunch of cardboard is the only sound as the cheap Pizza Time logo comes in and goes out of the foreground. They hear a truck rattling closer. Through the window, they see a STREET FUMIGATION TRUCK spewing gas as it passes by. The fog rolls closer to the window. KI-JUNG (to Ki-Woo) Close the window. KI-TEK Leave it. Free fumigation. Get rid of the damn crickets. Ki-Woo, who was about to close the window, sits back down. The FOG quickly envelops the family as they continue to fold. It’s rather poignant. A family braving through tear-inducing fumes just to make a meager living. CHUNG-SOOK (gasps) Shit! KI-JUNG (coughing) I told you to close it! CHUNG-SOOK Fuck me. 3. 4 4 Ki-Tek continues folding despite his red, bulging face. He desperately holds back his cough. Ki-Woo goes to the bathroom and returns moments later with his phone. He shows the family a GIF he downloaded. KI-WOO Watch. If we all fold like this girl, we might even get paid today. The GIF shows “The World’s Fastest Pizza Box Folder,” a WHITE GIRL with dazzling box-folding skills. She’s fast. The family watches in awe. Inspired by the clip, they start folding with renewed vigor. Ki-Tek also picks up speed, but he lacks the dexterity of the others. He’s getting more and more sloppy. INT/EXT. SEMI-BASEMENT - ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON Through the half-open door, we see the female PIZZA SHOP OWNER standing outside the entrance. Quirky appearance. Pizza Time T-shirt. PIZZA SHOP OWNER Look at this for example. This shitty folding job here. The Owner shows Chung-Sook a botched corner. PIZZA SHOP OWNER (CONT’D) One out of four. One-fourth of the boxes are unusable. One out of four? The family all look at Ki-Tek. He just smiles. Innocent as ever. CHUNG-SOOK (sighs) Still, you can’t cut ten percent from my pay. That’s too much. LATER -- Ki-Woo helps a MAN load boxes into a van. Ki-Tek looks out from the apartment window, watching Chung-Sook squabble with the Pizza Shop Owner. PIZZA SHOP OWNER I should pay even less considering the number of botched boxes. 4. CHUNG-SOOK We were barely making anything to begin with. PIZZA SHOP OWNER Look. It’s not that simple. Each ruined box exponentially tarnishes our brand’s image. CHUNG-SOOK Your “brand”? You only have two stores in Seoul. Fuck this-- PIZZA SHOP OWNER What did you say? Ki-Woo quickly steps in, diffusing the situation with an easy smile. KI-WOO It’s that kid, isn’t it? PIZZA SHOP OWNER What are you talking about? KI-WOO The part-timer at your shop. He went MIA, didn’t he? During such a crucial time too. You have a large group order from The Love of Christ Church. That’s why you and your husband are out here working your bottoms off. PIZZA SHOP OWNER How do you know that? Who told you? KI-WOO That kid, he’s my friend. KI-JUNG Totally unreliable. Not-sostellar reputation. KI-WOO I understand you’re upset. Ten percent? Fine, we accept. That’s completely within your authority. However-- PIZZA SHOP OWNER However what? KI-WOO Would you consider hiring a new employee? 5. 5 5 KI-JUNG Fire the loser who bailed on you. The Owner just stares at the smiling siblings. What the hell are these people? KI-WOO I can come in for an interview tomorrow. What would be a good time for you? PIZZA SHOP OWNER Wait. Hold on. I need to think about this-- The Owner senses a trap and tries to get out of it. She takes out a few bills from her fanny pack and starts counting one by one. The family all stare. It’s been a while since they’ve seen money. INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING The ‘master bedroom’ next to the entrance. Wall adorned with pictures of a young Chung-Sook competing at a national track and field championship as a student athlete. A SHOT PUTTER. Great upper body glimpsed through tight uniform. No pictures of Ki-Tek. Early evening. It’s darker. The four family members are gathered around a table filled with various store-bought foods. KI-TEK What a special occasion. The four of us gathered here to celebrate the partial reactivation of our phones as well as our son’s upcoming job interview with a national franchise. Ki-Tek tries to deliver a heartfelt speech like a TV patriarch but severely lacks the gravitas. Chung-Sook and Ki-Jung are already drinking their beers. KI-WOO Cheers! KI-TEK To family! (re: window) That son of a bitch. It’s not even dark yet! 6. The family turns to see -- A DRUNK MAN teetering toward the semi-basement window. Their faces slowly fill with dread. CHUNG-SOOK How many times did I tell you? We need to put up a “No Urinating” sign. KI-TEK It’ll make them want to do it even more. It’s psychology. KI-JUNG (to Ki-Woo) Go yell at him or something! KI-WOO It’s not the right timing-- The Drunk Man hasn’t unzipped his pants, still hovering uncertainly in the dark corner. KI-WOO (CONT’D) (hesitates) I need to catch him in the act. CHUNG-SOOK Isn’t it fucking obvious? Just kick him out! KI-JUNG (to herself) I hate this place. Ki-Woo gets up, still unsure, when -- VOICE (O.S.) HEY, MISTER! A VOICE booms from afar. Behind the Drunk Man, we see a handsome, well-built young man climbing off a fancy scooter. This is MIN-HYUK, 24. He walks over with a LARGE BOX in his hands. KI-JUNG Is that Min-Hyuk? CHUNG-SOOK It is. Ki-Woo is surprised to see Min-Hyuk, who continues to yell at the would-be public urinater. 7. MIN-HYUK What do you think you’re doing? You think this is a public toilet? DRUNK MAN I, uh-- MIN-HYUK What are you looking at! Cowed by Min-Hyuk’s presence, the Drunk Man quickly skedaddles away. Ki-Tek taps Ki-Woo on the shoulder. KI-TEK Your friend has mucho cajones. CHUNG-SOOK It’s that college student glow. Look at that confidence. KI-JUNG Which Ki-Woo obviously doesn’t have. A smitten Ki-Jung admires Min-Hyuk as he walks over to the apartment. He enters. MIN-HYUK How are you, Mr. and Mrs. Kim! KI-TEK Min-Hyuk! Good to see you, son! KI-WOO What’s with the surprise appearance? MIN-HYUK I texted you. (to Ki-Jung) Hey, Ki-Jung. Ki-Jung smiles shyly as she nods. Ki-Woo searches through his text messages. KI-WOO We could have met somewhere else. You didn’t have to come all this way. MIN-HYUK I brought this. 8. Min-Hyuk shows Ki-Woo the box. MIN-HYUK (CONT’D) It’s heavy so I had to bring it on my bike. KI-JUNG What’s this? Ki-Jung lifts the flap to see a UNIQUELY SHAPED STONE and a wooden display stand inside. MIN-HYUK (to Ki-Tek) When I told my grandfather I was going to see Ki-Woo, he gave me this. KI-TEK Whoa. Ki-Tek picks up the large stone. KI-TEK (CONT’D) This is a precious viewing stone. Is this an abstract specimen? MIN-HYUK You know your stones, Mr. Kim. Pop-Pop’s been collecting viewing stones since his academy days. Our house is literally filled with these things -- living room, study, basement... This one is supposed to bring luck. And money. KI-WOO How perfect for us. Symbolic. KI-TEK Yes, how serendipitous. Please send him our sincere regards. CHUNG-SOOK (to herself) He should’ve brought food. Ki-Jung stabs Chung-Sook with her finger. Fortunately Min-Hyuk didn’t hear. As a beaming Ki-Tek continues to show off useless stone trivia 9. 6 6 CUT TO: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STORE - NIGHT Min-Hyuk and Ki-Woo sit at a portable table outside the store, drinking soju and chasing it with chips. Min-Hyuk’s expensive foreign scooter is parked behind him. It visually clashes with the old grocery store and run-down alley. MIN-HYUK I had to bring that stupid rock, but it was nice to see your folks. They look good. KI-WOO They’re not as good as they look. They’re all jobless. MIN-HYUK Ki-Jung’s at home too? She doesn’t take college prep classes? KI-WOO It’s not that she doesn’t want to. She can’t. Ki-Woo downs a shot of soju. Min-Hyuk looks at Ki-Woo. He has something to say. He takes out his phone and shows Ki-Woo -- A picture of a brightly smiling TEENAGE GIRL. High school uniform. Innocent. MIN-HYUK Cute, right? KI-WOO Is that her? The girl you’re tutoring? Min-Hyuk nods. MIN-HYUK Park Da-Hae. A sophomore. I want you to tutor her. Take over for me as her English teacher. KI-WOO That makes no sense. MIN-HYUK Her family’s loaded. The gig pays really well. 10. That gets Ki-Woo’s attention. He looks at the picture again. MIN-HYUK (CONT’D) She’s a good kid. I want you to look after her until I come back from the study-abroad program. KI-WOO You have plenty of friends at school. Why do you want a highschool grad to teach your prized student? MIN-HYUK Why do you think? I shudder just thinking about those femalestarved engineering students drooling around her like hungry wolves. It’s revolting. Ki-Woo studies Min-Hyuk. KI-WOO (laughs) You like her, don’t you? MIN-HYUK (nods) I’m serious about her. I’m going to ask her out in two years, once she’s in college. I want you to take care of her while I’m gone. I trust you. KI-WOO I appreciate the trust, but you want me to pretend I’m a college student? MIN-HYUK Ki-Woo, think about it. How many times have you taken the college entrance exam? Twice before your military service and twice after -- a grand total of four times. Grammar, vocabulary, composition, speaking. You’re an English master. Far more qualified as a tutor than I am. Better than those spoiled college brats who drown their brain cells in booze everyday. KI-WOO That may be true but-- You think the family would accept me? I’m not even a college student. 11. 7 7 MIN-HYUK We’ll embellish a little. You’ll be fine. You’ll have my recommendation. And the mother is a bit-- Min-Hyuk picks up his glass to drink when he suddenly becomes thoughtful. He smiles. MIN-HYUK (CONT’D) She’s simple. Young. And simple. KI-WOO (English) Simple? What do you mean? MIN-HYUK (English) I don’t know. Just simple. Min-Hyuk and Ki-Woo start conversing in English for no reason. They’re fluent. MIN-HYUK (CONT’D) I hear Ki-Jung is handy with Photoshop. INT. INTERNET CAFÉ - DAY Ki-Jung is working at the computer, clicking the mouse and tapping various keyboard shortcuts with dizzying speed. She’s like a magician. On the monitor is a document -- “Certificate of Enrollment.” With laser focus, Ki-Jung refines the edges of the red certification seal. KI-WOO This is amazing. How come you keep failing the art school exam? KI-JUNG Shut up, dickwad. The siblings work discreetly in the corner of the large internet café. KI-WOO Take your time. (looking around) We should hold off on the printing until the place clears out. 12. 8 8 9 9 INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - DAY Ki-Tek is on the floor laying his head on the viewing stone. He admires the freshly printed enrollment certificate. KI-TEK Look at this. There should be a major for document forgery at Seoul National University. KiJung would be top of the class. CHUNG-SOOK Shut up and wish the boy good luck for his interview. KI-TEK My son-- Ki-Tek sits up. KI-TEK (CONT’D) I’m so proud of you. A slightly awkward and embarrassing moment. They all know KiWoo did nothing to be proud of. Ki-Woo finishes touching up his hair in front of the mirror. He picks up the fake certificate. KI-WOO I don’t consider this a crime. No. Because I plan on going to this school next year. KI-TEK That’s my son. Man with a plan. KI-WOO I’m just using some of their administrative services in advance. EXT. RICH NEIGHBORHOOD - ROAD - DAY A quiet road snaking up the hill of a wealthy neighborhood. High walls. Not a pedestrian in sight. Except Ki-Woo, who consults the map on his phone as he walks up the hill, backpack strapped. He looks around. Walks faster. 13. 10 10 11 11 EXT. MANSION - GATE - DAY Ki-Woo stands in front of the gate, which is at the top of a steep stairway. He waits through the MELODIC DOORBELL until a VOICE finally answers. The voice is middle-aged, female. FEMALE VOICE (SPEAKER) Who is it? KI-WOO Mrs. Park? Hi, I’m Min-Hyuk’s friend-- FEMALE VOICE (SPEAKER) Oh, hello. Please come in. CLANK. The gate is unlocked, and Ki-Woo walks into -- A GORGEOUSLY MANICURED GARDEN LINED WITH MAJESTIC TREES Ki-Woo stops midway and admires the trees, overcome with awe. MUN-KWANG (O.S.) Quite a view, isn’t it? KI-WOO Mrs. Park, pleasure to meet you. MUN-KWANG Oh, no. I’m the housekeeper. Please follow me. MUN-KWANG, 45, fashionable and poised enough to be mistaken for the owner, leads Ki-Woo inside. KI-WOO Stunning garden. MUN-KWANG The inside is even more stunning. INT. MANSION - DAY Ki-Woo carefully follows Mun-Kwang inside. Indeed, the interior is stunning. But not excessive. The furniture and decorations are all tasteful. MUN-KWANG Do you know Namgoong Hyunja? The famous Korean-French architect? Ki-woo is blank. 14. MUN-KWANG (CONT’D) This used to be his house. He built it. KI-WOO I see. MUN-KWANG Now it’s just Da-Hae’s house. Mun-Kwang stops just short of the fabulous living room overlooking the garden, arriving at the equally fabulous and spacious -- KITCHEN / DINING ROOM She seats Ki-Woo at the large wooden table. MUN-KWANG (CONT’D) Please wait here. I’ll get Mrs. Park. Mun-Kwang exits, and Ki-Woo is left alone in silence. He quietly gets up and looks around. There’s some kind of AVANT-GARDE ART hanging on the wall. Next to it, he sees a typical Korean FAMILY PORTRAIT taken at a studio. Ki-Woo walks over to the window, which overlooks the backyard. He sees -- A WOMAN dozing off at the patio table. English magazine open on the table. Head tilted comically. Only her soft white neck is visible. This is YON-KYO, 41. Mun-Kwang walks over and CLAPS her hands loudly next to YonKyo’s ears. Yon-Kyo sucks her drool in and slowly raises her head. We hear their muffled voices through the window. MUN-KWANG (CONT’D) The tutor is here. YON-KYO What do you think of him? MUN-KWANG (smiles) I don’t know, but he’s handsome. 15. 12 INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - DAY 12 Yon-Kyo sits with Ki-Woo at the dining table. She pulls out the fake certificate halfway, glimpses at it, then puts it back in. Ki-Woo is nervous. Even the DOG, cradled in Yon-Kyo’s arms, is watching him. Panting. Disapproving. YON-KYO I don’t care about papers. I only wanted to see you because you were recommended by Min-Hyuk. I guess you two are good friends. Ki-Woo listens quietly. YON-KYO (CONT’D) I’m sure you know better than I do, but Min-Hyuk is just the most brilliant human being. I don’t even care about the grades. DaHae and I absolutely adored him. Do you know what I mean? KI-WOO Of course. YON-KYO We just loved him so much. I wanted him to stay with Da-Hae through her college exams next year, but now he’s leaving to study abroad and I’m suddenly left without a tutor. I mean, what am I supposed to do? Ki-Woo listens, respectful. YON-KYO (CONT’D) Excuse my bluntness, but I just don’t see the point of hiring someone unless he’s as utterly outstanding as Min-Hyuk, you know? Mun-Kwang sneaks a glance at Ki-Woo as she brings coffee over to the table, checking him out. CLINK. She sets it down loudly in front of Ki-Woo. YON-KYO (CONT’D) I guess what I wanted to ask was -- Would it be okay if I sat in for today’s class? I want to see the whole thing. Judge for myself. I would like to see your -- methods. 16. 13 13 14 14 KI-WOO Uh... YON-KYO (English) Is that okay with you? Yon-Kyo suddenly blurts out a question in English. Her English is terrible. INT. MANSION - STAIRCASE - DAY Ki-Woo follows Yon-Kyo up the large, oppressive staircase, trying his best not look at her conspicuously swaying hips. He arrives on the second floor where he sees -- A long hallway with several doors on each side. INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON A large, pretty room. Yon-Kyo and her dog are sitting on the bed watching Ki-Woo. The attention doesn’t bother Ki-Woo, who is calmly focused on DA-HAE as she works through a practice test. KI-WOO Are you sure about question 14? DA-HAE (hesitant) Is it wrong? KI-WOO I’m asking you. What does your gut say? Do you think number 14 is right? Da-Hae shrinks. KI-WOO (CONT’D) You were working on other questions before you came back to 14. Am I right? DA-HAE Yes. Ki-Woo suddenly snatches Da-Hae’s wrist, shocking both Da-Hae and her mom. He presses his thumb gently and feels her pulse like doctor. 17. KI-WOO If this was a real test and number 14 was the first question, you would’ve been in trouble from the start. He presses harder. KI-WOO (CONT’D) See? You pulse is irregular. Your heart doesn’t lie. Da-Hae turns bright red. Yon-Kyo is speechless, either appalled or in awe. KI-WOO (CONT’D) What are you supposed to do in a test? You move forward. You need to seize the flow. The rhythm. If not, you’re screwed. I don’t care about question number 14. I only care about how you seize the flow. How you conquer the test as a whole. You get it? Da-Hae is quiet. KI-WOO (CONT’D) A test is all about confidence. (English) Attitude. Stunned silence. Ki-Woo finally lets go of Da-Hae’s wrist, revealing a round, pink spot where he held her. Ki-Woo looks over at Yon-Kyo. She’s completely floored. KI-WOO (CONT’D) I know. You were angry. Frustrated. You worked so hard. Studied until your nose bled. But your test scores weren’t improving. You keep asking yourself, ‘What am I doing wrong?’ That triggers something in Da-Hae. Emotions swell, and her pupils tremble. KI-WOO (CONT’D) I’m here to prepare you for the real thing. I’m not here to help you learn. I’m here to help you score. 18. 15 INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - EVENING 15 CLOSE ON a thick money envelope being handed to Ki-Woo. YON-KYO I’ll pay you each month on this day. As for the lesson, I was thinking three times a week? Monday, Wednesday, Friday? KI-WOO That sounds good. YON-KYO It’s a little more than what MinHyuk used to get. Cost of living and so forth. KI-WOO Thank you. As Ki-Woo puts away the envelope, Mun-Kwang brings over a fruit plate. She’s noticeably friendlier than before. YON-KYO (to Mun-Kwang) I guess it’s time to get to know each other. Mr. Kevin will be DaHae’s English teacher. MUN-KWANG Of course! Mr. Kevin, you let me know if you need anything at all during your lessons -- snacks, drinks, whatever. KI-WOO I appreciate it. YON-KYO Feel free to pester her if you need anything in this house. She’s the expert. She knows it better than I do. They continue exchanging pleasantries when -- THUNK. A PLASTIC ARROW flies in and hits Mun-Kwang’s shoulder. When Ki-Woo looks over -- It’s a boy in a Native American costume about to shoot another arrow. This is DA-SONG, 10, the youngest Park. YON-KYO (CONT’D) Da-Song! Behave yourself. We have a guest! 19. Da-Song doesn’t care. He continues shooting. Mun-Kwang is used to the antics. She picks up an arrow and rubs it in her armpit. MUN-KWANG (silly laugh) Armpit attack! DA-SONG No!! It stinks! Da-Song plucks a TOY AXE from his belt and starts running in ‘slow motion’ toward Mun-Kwang. He screams like a warrior. Mun-Kwang does the same, flailing in fake slow motion. They make quite a pair. YON-KYO (sighs) I apologize. Our son is a little --unique. KI-WOO Unique is good. YON-KYO He has trouble focusing. ADHD. We signed him up for the Cub Scouts hoping the discipline would help, but he’s become an even bigger weirdo. Now he’s obsessed with Indians-- KI-WOO (laughs) The Scouts have roots in American Indian culture, so he has the right idea. YON-KYO You were a Scout too? KI-WOO Yes, I learned a lot as a Scout. YON-KYO Look how fine you turned out. What’s wrong with him? (then, serious) He’s actually an art prodigy, you know. Did you see the drawings? (re: pictures on the wall) Those are his. 20. 16 16 Ki-Woo turns toward the AVANT-GARDE DRAWINGS on the wall. He gazes for a long moment. KI-WOO A lot of symbolism. Such strong point of view. YON-KYO Right? Strong. I knew you would get it, Mr. Kevin. Ki-Woo takes a couple of steps back and admires the drawings with a serious face. KI-WOO I see. It’s an interpretation of a chimpanzee. YON-KYO It’s a self-portrait. Awkward. Crickets chirp as Da-Song and Mun-Kwang continue to battle it out in the background. KI-WOO Of course. Us grown-ups are too jaded to see true genius. EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - EVENING YON-KYO That must be why. We’ve gone through dozens of art teachers. They never last more than a month. Of course Da-Song is a bit much to handle. Ki-Woo nods. Yon-Kyo has come to see him out with the dog in her arms. The gate opens. Ki-Woo begins to step out when he stops. KI-WOO Actually... Mrs. Park. YON-KYO Yes? KI-WOO Someone just happened to come to my mind. Her name is-- 21. 17 17 Through Yon-Kyo’s POV, we see the back of Ki-Woo’s head as he seemingly tries to remember. KI-WOO (CONT’D) Girl’s Generation. The girl group. What was her name -- the one who started the jewelry brand? YON-KYO Jessica? KI-WOO Right! Jessica. My cousin has a school friend named Jessica. I don’t know her Korean name. She studied applied arts at Illinois State and recently moved back to Korea. YON-KYO Ah, Illinois State. What about her? KI-WOO She also tutors, and she’s known to have a very unique approach to teaching art. Most of all, she knows how to handle kids. YON-KYO (interested) Is that so? KI-WOO She’s a bit of a celebrity in tutoring circles. Her style is a little unorthodox, but it still gets kids into good art schools. YON-KYO She sounds fantastic. I’m so curious. KI-WOO Would you be interested in meeting her? She’s very busy so I’m not sure if I’ll be able to get an appointment-- INT. HAIR SALON - DAY KI-JUNG Jessica? (laughs) Why Jessica. So tacky. 22. 18 18 Ki-Jung is getting her hair done at the neighborhood shop. Ki-Woo is sucking on a popsicle on the sofa behind her. KI-WOO It has a nice ring. Anyhow. She’s a nice lady. Young. Not the brightest tool in the shed. The money is good, and most of all, she’s a ‘believer.’ CHUNG-SOOK She’s religious? TRACK BACK TO REVEAL -- Chung-Sook and Ki-Tek sitting next to Ki-Jung, also getting their hairs trimmed. KI-WOO No, it’s just-- She tends to trust people rather easily. They become thoughtful. Ki-Tek breaks the silence. KI-TEK She sounds like a great lady. KI-WOO Right? CHUNG-SOOK Yeah. The family members all nod. A strange excitement appears on their faces. EXT. MANSION - GATE - LATE AFTERNOON Ki-Woo and Ki-Jung both take a deep breath in front of the gate. Ki-Jung looks like a completely new person with short, stylish hair and makeup. Ki-Woo is about to ring the doorbell when Ki-Jung stops him. She suddenly starts clapping a beat with her hands. KI-JUNG (singing) Jessica, only child, Chicago Illinois / My classmate Jin-Mo is cousin of Kevin She sings her ‘bio’ to the tune of a catchy Korean oldie. KiWoo joins. Silly. Ridiculous. But you can sense a real sibling bond. 23. 19 19 20 20 Finally Ki-Woo presses the button, and the DOORBELL rings throughout the quiet neighborhood. INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - EVENING We find Da-Song at the bottom of the stairs peeking inside the kitchen where -- Yon-Kyo is interviewing Ki-Jung. They talk quietly. Formal. Serious. Ki-Woo sits a few feet away. Da-Hae tiptoes down from second floor and sees Da-Song peeking. She flicks his forehead and sends him upstairs. She then looks inside the kitchen herself. She focuses on KiJung, scrutinizing, suspicious. KI-WOO I should go upstairs for my lesson. I’ll let you two talk. (to Ki-Jung) Jessica, nice meeting you. Ki-Woo gets up and nods to Ki-Jung. KI-WOO (CONT’D) I’ll see you next time. Ki-Jung also stands up, cordial. KI-JUNG Thank you, Kevin. Da-Hae sees Ki-Woo coming and runs back up the stairs. INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - EVENING Da-Hae hurries back to her desk and pretends to work on her problems. The door opens, and Ki-Woo enters. He sits next to Da-Hae. KI-WOO Where did we leave off? Number 17? DA-HAE You know-- KI-WOO What is it? DA-HAE You know it’s all an act, right? My brother. 24. KI-WOO What are you talking about? DA-HAE It’s all fake. Acting all bizarro. Like he’s a crazed artist. He’s a big fraud. KI-WOO Da-Song? DA-HAE You know, like he would stop in the middle of the street and pretend he was struck by a sudden inspiration. KI-WOO (laughs) Randomly stare up at the clouds and ponder the shapes? Something like that? DA-HAE Exactly! He’s the worst! And he acts like he can’t behave normal. Like he’s completely perplexed. Makes me want to puke. KI-WOO So Da-Song is a fraud. What does that have to do with your English problems? Dae-Hae pouts when Ki-Woo suddenly returns to tutor mode. DA-HAE I’m just saying. KI-WOO Good. Now those were all great descriptions of Da-Song. Why don’t we use them to compose a paragraph in English? You must use the word ‘pretend’ at least twice. Ki-Woo, master tutor, skillfully guides the conversation back to the lesson. But Da-Hae still has something on her mind. She puts down her pen. DA-HAE Can I ask you something? 25. KI-WOO What now? DA-HAE The teacher downstairs. Ms. Jessica. Is she really your cousin’s friend? This catches Ki-Woo off guard. He disguises it with a smile. KI-WOO I don’t know what you’re talking about. DA-HAE She’s your girlfriend, isn’t she? Ki-Woo relaxes and laughs. He looks at Da-Hae, who is all worried and serious. She’s cute. KI-WOO Come on. I just met her today. DA-HAE (pouting) She’s very pretty. Not even interested? KI-WOO She is pretty. A beauty even. DA-HAE I knew it. You are interested. KI-WOO If you were a perfect ten, maybe she would be a six? Six-pointfive? A cheesy line, but Da-Hae smiles, pleased. Suddenly, she grabs Ki-Woo’s wrist under the desk. She presses it gently, feeling his pulse. A bold, unexpected move on her part. Ki-Woo stares quietly at Da-Hae. Slowly, they grow closer. Lips converge. A soft, gentle kiss held through silence until They hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. KI-WOO (CONT’D) Let’s study. DA-HAE Right. 26. 21 INT. MANSION - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - EVENING 21 Yon-Kyo and Ki-Jung pass Da-Hae’s room and walk toward DaSong’s. Yon-Kyo turns to Ki-Jung, nervous. YON-KYO I should tell you. He’s not good at staying in one place. (apologetic) I hope you understand-- KI-JUNG It’s fine. Ki-Jung has no expression. Nothing fazes her. Yon-Kyo hesitates before finally opening the door to reveal -- DA-SONG’S ROOM A huge clutter. Covered with Da-Song’s drawings as well as pictures of Native American tribesmen. All kinds of Indianthemed toys. A TEEPEE TENT imported from America. Da-Song is lying on the floor with a toy arrow tucked between his legs. Staring at the ceiling. In his own world. This may also be an act. KI-JUNG (CONT’D) Would you mind leaving? YON-KYO Excuse me? KI-JUNG I don’t allow parents to sit in during lessons. Yon-Kyo is surprised. She continues to linger, but Ki-Jung’s stare is unwavering. YON-KYO I just thought, since it’s the first day-- As you can see, the boy is a bit-- KI-JUNG You should wait downstairs. Yon-Kyo finally backs down, subdued by Ki-Jung’s authority. She walks out of the room. 27. 22 INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT 22 TICK TOCK TICK TOCK. Yon-Kyo and Mun-Kwang nibble on nuts as they pass time in the kitchen. The dog licks Yon-Kyo’s face, which is full of agony, worry, curiosity. Mun-Kwang sees Yon-Kyo’s state -- MUN-KWANG Would you like some plum extract? I can add some honey. It’ll help you relax. YON-KYO What? Oh. Sure. Mun-Kwang walks down a narrow set of stairs to the -- STORAGE BASEMENT Stocked with all kinds of foods, beverages, and other household necessities. On one side is a cabinet filled with numerous GLASS JARS -- hand-extracted plum, tangerine, and fig concentrates. Mun-Kwang picks up the plum bottle and twists the tightly locked lid when -- Yon-Kyo hurtles down the stairs. YON-KYO (CONT’D) I have an idea! This is what we’ll do! MUN-KWANG What? YON-KYO You’ll take two plum juices to DaSong’s room. You’re not a parent so you can go in. You’ll just be delivering the drinks. MUN-KWANG You’re right. I’ll take a quick peek and let you know how they’re doing. YON-KYO Dammit. Why didn’t I think of this before? MOMENTS LATER -- 28. Mun-Kwang and Yon-Kyo hurry back up the steps with a cup of plum extract. They are startled to see -- Ki-Jung and Da-Song waiting in the kitchen, already done with their lesson. Yon-Kyo tries to hide her surprise. YON-KYO (CONT’D) You guys are... done? Ki-Jung is holding a picture drawn by Da-Song. Da-Song is standing politely behind her. KI-JUNG Mrs. Park, will you please have a seat? YON-KYO (nervous) Sure. KI-JUNG Da-Song, you go up. Yon-Kyo and Mun-Kwang are stunned to see -- Da-Song obediently bowing and heading up the stairs. What?! Ki-Jung hands Yon-Kyo the drawing. KI-JUNG (CONT’D) Da-Song drew this today. Yon-Kyo is scared. She has no idea what’s going on. Ki-Jung clocks Mun-Kwang peeking over Yon-Kyo’s shoulders. KI-JUNG (CONT’D) I’d like to speak to you alone. YON-KYO Oh, this is-- KI-JUNG Can you please give us a moment? Yon-Kyo’s voice falters at Ki-Jung’s ice-cold demeanor. Mun-Kwang stares hard at Ki-Jung before walking away. KI-JUNG (CONT’D) I mentioned earlier that I’m also studying art therapy. YON-KYO Yes, I remember-- 29. KI-JUNG (re: drawing) Did something happen to Da-Song when he was in first grade? Yon-Kyo yelps loudly! She quickly covers her mouth. Her hands start shaking. KI-JUNG (CONT’D) I feel a bit cautious about bringing this up -- it’s the first day after all -- but I’ll need to know what happened to Da-Song in order to truly understand him. YON-KYO When he was in first grade-- (tearful) I’m sorry. I don’t know if I can talk about this right now. KI-JUNG It’s fine. We can talk about it later. Ki-Jung puts a finger on the drawing. KI-JUNG (CONT’D) Here. This lower section is what’s called the ‘schizophrenia zone’ in psychology. It contains clues about the mental state of the child. Do you see this particular shape drawn here? YON-KYO Yes. Yes, I do. Yon-Kyo suddenly looks up from the drawing and stares at the large framed picture on the wall. YON-KYO (CONT’D) My gosh! It’s in the other drawing too! Same spot! Ki-Jung looks back at the picture. KI-JUNG Yes. Same spot, same pattern. Yon-Kyo nods fervently. She sobs harder. She feels like a horrible mother. 30. YON-KYO I see that picture everyday. Every time I eat. (sobs) I had no idea. KI-JUNG You don’t have to beat yourself up. These drawings are records of Da-Song’s emotions. A black box of his soul. I’d like to try and unlock that box. But I’ll need time. YON-KYO Of course. Please take as much time as you need. I can wait. KI-JUNG (calm) I suggest four two-hour sessions a week -- Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. This is different from regular tutoring -- it’s art therapy -- so I would need to be compensated at a higher rate. YON-KYO Of course. I understand. Ki-Jung continues her performance as multi-certified art teacher and therapist Jessica when -- We hear a car pull into the garage. Moments later, DONG-IK PARK, 45, Yon-Kyo’s husband and Da-Song’s father, emerges from the stairs next to the front entrance. We notice the AUTOMATED MOTION-SENSOR LIGHTS blinking above the main entrance as Dong-Ik walks in. YUN, 31, the driver, follows up with Dong-Ik’s things. YON-KYO (CONT’D) Oh-- Yon-Kyo wipes her tears. YON-KYO (CONT’D) Dong-Ik. Say hi to Ms. Jessica, Da-Song’s new art teacher. She just started today. (to Jessica; in English) Jessica, this is Dong-Ik. KI-JUNG (curt) Hello. 31. 23 23 Dong-Ik looks tired. But even the fatigue adds to his mystique and cool as a high-flying CEO. He shares a brief handshake with Ki-Jung. DONG-IK Thank you for helping Da-Song. (to Yon-Kyo) Are they done for the day? YON-KYO Yes, they just finished. DONG-IK (to Yun) Sorry Yun, but are you busy tonight? Would you mind taking Ms. Jessica home? I don’t want her walking down the hill alone at night. INT. DONG-IK’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT Ki-Jung sits quietly in the back. She looks quite natural in the backseat of the swanky Mercedes. Yun sneaks glances at Ki-Jung through the rearview mirror. YUN Where do you live, Ms. Jessica? I might as well just drive you home-- KI-JUNG It’s fine. Just drop me off at Hyehwa Station. Thank you. Ki-Jung’s cold demeanor intrigues Yun instead of putting him off. He’s attracted. He tries again. YUN Doesn’t matter if it’s far. I’m done for the day-- KI-JUNG I’ll get off at Hyehwa. Yun looks out the window. YUN It looks like it’s about to rain. I bet the Mercedes is way better than the subway-- 32. 24 24 KI-JUNG (cutting him off) No. I’m supposed to meet my boyfriend at the station. YUN I see. Yun’s smile disappears. He quietly turns the steering wheel. Ki-Jung stares at the back of Yun’s head, thinking. Then -- She slowly reaches under her skirt and starts rolling down her underwear! Her eyes twinkle in the dark as she holds the removed underwear in her hands. INT. BUFFET RESTAURANT - DAY KI-JUNG Did you drive Benzes when you were a designated driver? KI-TEK Not when I was at the designated driver service. I drove a lot of them when I was a valet. KI-JUNG When were you a valet? CHUNG-SOOK After the fried chicken and before the Taiwanese Castella. About six months, I’d say? KI-TEK Nah. It was after the Castella shop went bust. Ki-Tek and family stack food onto their already mountainous plates as they move along the buffet line. They’re at a large budget restaurant frequented by BUS AND TAXI DRIVERS. Ki-Woo makes sure no one is listening before -- KI-WOO We’re already starting Phase Three? KI-JUNG I planted a little trap in the Mercedes. We’ll see if he bites. 33. KI-WOO Then it’s begun. (looking around) Father, how amazing is this? We just so happen to be eating at a buffet for drivers. How symbolic! Ki-Tek doesn’t get it but beams anyway. KI-TEK This place IS amazing! You guys eat as much as you want! CHUNG-SOOK You’re not even buying, you big bum. They are. Ki-Tek is still happy. He’s grown immune to Chung-Sook’s insults. KI-TEK Here. He puts some of his meat on Ki-Woo’s plate. KI-TEK (CONT’D) Have some of this, Son. KI-WOO Thanks, Dad! (to Ki-Jung) By the way, what did you say to Mrs. Park yesterday? KI-JUNG Why? KI-WOO She was over the moon about you. Saying that you were a godsend. A freaking miracle FedExed from heaven. KI-JUNG (laughs) I just googled ‘art therapy’ and did a little improv, and she just lost her shit. Started crying like a baby. Can’t believe how gullible she is. 34. 25 25 26 26 INT. DONG-IK’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT Dong-Ik is going through some papers in the back when one drops under the seat. As he reaches down to grab it -- He sees a vague WHITE SHAPE beneath the passenger seat. He picks it up. A pair of women’s underwear. Ki-Jung’s. Dong-Ik looks disgusted. He stares hard at the back of Yun’s head before putting the underwear in his pocket. INT. MANSION - ENTRANCE - NIGHT Dong-Ik rushes up the garage stairs. He passes the blinking motion-sensor lights and stomps toward the -- KITCHEN YON-KYO What’s wrong? Something happen? Dong-Ik checks to see if the kids are around. DONG-IK It’s Yun. That son of a bitch. I found this under the car seat. Dong-Ik pulls out the panties from his pocket. Yon-Kyo gasps, shocked. Perhaps more outraged than necessary. DONG-IK (CONT’D) You pay him well, don’t you? He doesn’t have money to go to a hotel? Is he saving that money for something? YON-KYO Maybe he’s a sexual deviant? He might get off on doing it in his boss’ car. Yon-Kyo sees -- Dong-Ik is in no mood. YON-KYO (CONT’D) I’m sorry, babe. I had no idea that he was such a perv. DONG-IK I don’t care who or what he screws. That’s his business. I get it. He’s a young guy.  (MORE) 35. DONG-IK (CONT’D) But why does he have to do it in my car? And why in the backseat? That’s my space. Is he trying to mark his territory? With his dirty cum stains? Son of a bitch crossed the line. Yon-Kyo doesn’t know what to do. Her husband rarely gets this upset. Dong-Ik calms down and looks at the underwear. DONG-IK (CONT’D) (quiet) You know what’s even weirder? YON-KYO (nervous) What? DONG-IK Don’t you see? Think about it. Yon-Kyo is freaked out of her mind. DONG-IK (CONT’D) So they have sex in the car. It’s not unusual to leave behind a few strands of hair, maybe an earring. But how do you forget your underwear? YON-KYO It’s true. You don’t just forget to put on your knickers. DONG-IK That’s why. I’m more concerned by his -- partner. Her mental state. Do you know what I mean? Dong-Ik checks the surroundings before whispering something in Yon-Kyo’s ear. YON-KYO NOOOO-- (turning pale) Like methamphetamine? Cocaine? DONG-IK Shhhh! YON-KYO What do we do? If they find some kind of white powder in your car, we’re all doomed! 36. DONG-IK Calm down, babe. Relax. We don’t want to go too far. Not yet. For now it’s just a suspicion. A well-founded one. As the Parks continue to fret over the panties, CAMERA BOOMS UP TO REVEAL -- Ki-Jung standing on the stairs with her bag, listening to the conversation. DONG-IK (CONT’D) We can’t even take something like this to the police. And it would look ridiculous if I tried to interrogate him. What would I say? “Yun, did you have sexual intercourse in my car?” (then) That’s why I was thinking-- YON-KYO Yes, dear. DONG-IK You have to take care of this. Come up with some kind of bland, harmless reason. Let him go quietly. Don’t even mention the panties. Or the intercourse. YON-KYO I understand. We don’t want the neighborhood birds gossiping about the Parks’ driver sexing up the boss’ car. DONG-IK Exactly. Our names will forever be linked with his disgusting behavior. Yon-Kyo nods, then thinks. YON-KYO You don’t think Yun would post something online, do you? Go on a Twitter vendetta? He could announce to the whole world that he was unfairly fired by a famous tech CEO. 37. 27 27 DONG-IK We’ll pay him severance. Enough to keep him quiet. Just choose your words carefully when you let him go. Then we’ll be fine. Just then Ki-Jung starts walking down the stairs. Stepping loudly so the Parks can hear. Yon-Kyo leaps out of her seat. Dong-Ik quickly hides the underwear and puts on an awkward smile. YON-KYO (smiling) Are you guys done? How was DaSong today? EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - NIGHT Yon-Kyo and Ki-Jung walk toward the gate. Yon-Kyo sidles up to Ki-Jung, acting friendlier than usual. YON-KYO Ms. Jessica, I wanted to ask. The other night, when Yun took you home... KI-JUNG Yes? YON-KYO This may sound weird but-- Did anything happen that night? KI-JUNG No. I went straight home. YON-KYO Good, good. (relieved) That’s good to hear. KI-JUNG Such a nice man. I asked him to drop me off at Hyehwa Station, but he kept insisting that he would take me home. YON-KYO (raising her voice) So the bastard went to your house? At night? He knows where you live? KI-JUNG No. I just got off at Hyehwa. 38. YON-KYO (sighs) Thank God. You did the right thing. (English) Nice, Jessica. KI-JUNG Did something happen to him? Yon-Kyo opens the gate. YON-KYO He, well-- He won’t be working for us anymore. There was a bit of an incident. You don’t need to know the details. KI-JUNG That’s too bad. He seemed like a nice man. YON-KYO You’re so precious, Ms. Jessica. So innocent. You still have a lot to learn about this world. Ki-Jung stifles her laughter as she walks down the steps. She sees Mun-Kwang walking back home with the Parks’ THREE DOGS in the distance. Yon-Kyo waves at them. YON-KYO (CONT’D) (sighs) We used to like him too. We were excited to have a driver who was young and hip. KI-JUNG I thought most people preferred older drivers. YON-KYO Yes, it’s true. Older drivers tend to drive more carefully. They’re more sophisticated. KI-JUNG My uncle had a driver who was like that. Mr. Kim. A real gentleman. Such a kind man. We used to follow him like an uncle. YON-KYO Really? 39. 28 28 KI-JUNG Yes. He was such a warm and kindhearted person. Unfortunately, my uncle was transferred to Chicago and had to let Mr. Kim go. I don’t know what he’s doing these days-- YON-KYO I’m very interested in this person, Ms. Jessica. Do you think I could meet him? As you can see, it’s becoming harder and harder for me to trust people. I won’t hire anyone unless they’re recommended by people I absolutely, positively trust. I just have a feeling he could be a great candidate since you grew up with him and all. Mun-Kwang walks within earshot and hears the conversation. Her curiosity is piqued. The dogs wag their tails and swarm Yon-Kyo. KI-JUNG Would you like to meet him? (English) Are you serious? YON-KYO (English) I am deadly serious. (Korean) I think this is the best way to hire people. Through people I trust. It’s like a, what should I call it-- Yon-Kyo makes a peculiar hand gesture. YON-KYO (CONT’D) ‘Belt of Trust.’ As the scene’s THEME MUSIC (titled “The Belt of Trust”) begins to play, we cut to the inside of a -- INT. MERCEDES Ki-Tek is in the driver seat. We don’t know whose car this is or where we are. He tries buckling the seat belt. Presses various buttons on the instrument panel. 40. 29 29 30 30 Ki-Woo is in the backseat, telling his father to try this and that. When some people approach, the pair hop out of the car and move onto another one, revealing that -- We are inside a large MERCEDES DEALERSHIP in the middle of Gangnam. Ki-Tek and Ki-Woo continue to explore brand new Benzes, sharing quality father and son time. INT. DONG-IK’S COMPANY - CEO OFFICE - DAY An office overlooking Seoul’s soaring skyscrapers. Dong-Ik is in a meeting with his HOD’s. He suddenly looks up at the other side of the glass wall where -- Ki-Tek is sitting in a chair, waiting patiently to be seen. DONG-IK (mouthing) Sorry. I’ll. Be. Right. With. You. KI-TEK Don’t worry, sir. (mouthing & gesturing) Take. Your. Time. INT. DONG-IK’S CAR - DRIVING - LATE AFTERNOON DONG-IK This isn’t a test or anything so you don’t have to be nervous. I just wanted to get out of the office. I was dying in there. Ki-Tek is in the driver seat. (”The Belt of Trust” continues under the scene.) KI-TEK I understand. You’re surrounded by people all day. I’m sure you want some peace in the car. Ki-Tek turns off the car’s navigation. DONG-IK Thank you. You must know your way around the city. KI-TEK Every highway, road, and alley south of the DMZ. When you do this for 30 years, it becomes second nature. 41. 31 31 DONG-IK I admire people who work in one profession their whole lives. KI-TEK It’s a simple job really. But I take pride in it. Every morning, I go on a journey. With a father, a CEO, or just a solitary man walking through life. It’s a sort of companionship-- DONG-IK Ah. KI-TEK That’s how I’ve treated my job for the past 30 years. How time flies. The words drip with cheese, but somehow they sound heartfelt when Ki-Tek says it with his humble stammer. As the MUSIC crests toward a climax -- Ki-Tek turns the wheel, making a smooth left turn. DONG-IK Exquisite corner-work. I can feel your experience. INT. MANSION - STAIRS - NIGHT As MUSIC continues -- SLOW MOTION of Ki-Jung gracefully, rhythmically walking down the stairs. She finds -- Mun-Kwang dozing off at the dining table. Lightly snoring. Dogs circling her feet. Ki-Jung stares for a long moment. As she walks past the dining room -- She SLAPS the wall loudly, shocking Mun-Kwang out of her daydream. Mun-Kwang acts like she wasn’t sleeping. KI-JUNG (V.O.) She’s an old fox. She acts like she’s Mrs. Park’s sister. 42. 32 32 33 33 INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - NIGHT Mun-Kwang leaves a plate of fruits for Ki-Woo and Da-Hae. Ki-Woo stares at her intently as she walks out. KI-WOO (V.O.) She’s been in the house the longest. Longer than the family. She used to work for the previous owner, the architect Namgoong Hyunja, who recommended her to the Parks when he moved to France. Told them she takes great care of the house and so on-- INT. PIZZA TIME - DAY CHUNG-SOOK So she survived an ownership change. KI-WOO (nods) It’s a made job. Of course she won’t just let go. KI-JUNG If we want to extract her, we’ll need to do some prep work. KI-WOO That’s right. We need a plan. Chung-Sook, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jung are sitting at the corner table. We notice the tacky Pizza Time logo everywhere. The Pizza Shop Owner (from Scene 4) begrudgingly brings a combination pizza over to the table. She hates that she has to serve these losers. CHUNG-SOOK Hey, how about some more hot sauce here? The Owner picks up a hot sauce from the other table and drops it in front of Chung-Sook. Chung-Sook mouths ‘bitch’ as the Owner walks away. Ki-Woo studies the hot sauce. He picks it up and squirts two drops on a blank napkin, as if testing something. 43. 34 34 35 35 36 36 37 37 KI-WOO There’s something that Da-Hae told me. INT. MANSION - DA-HAE’S ROOM - NIGHT DA-HAE I’m so sick of apples. I want peaches. KI-WOO Then why don’t you just ask for them? Da-Hae is griping about the fruit plate Mun-Kwang brought. She picks up an apple slice and lovingly feeds it to Ki-Woo. DA-HAE (pouting) We can’t have peaches. It’s a forbidden fruit in our house. INT. NEIGHBORHOOD STORE - DAY Ki-Jung picks up a PEACH from the fruit section. She holds it in the sunlight and carefully examines the soft fuzz surrounding it. KI-WOO (V.O.) The housekeeper has a severe peach allergy. If she even goes near a peach, she’ll turn red and start hyperventilating. Full-on asthma attack. Does everything but kill her. INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - KITCHEN - DAY Using a sharp razor, Ki-Woo meticulously shaves off the fuzz around the peach. He deposits the fuzz in a transparent pen cap. HAUNTING, NERVE-SCRAPING MUSIC plays underneath. EXT. MANSION - GARDEN - LATE AFTERNOON Ki-Woo walks out of the house after another lesson. He bows to Mun-Kwang, who is in the yard handing out treats to the dogs. Ki-Woo takes out his pen as he passes Mun-Kwang. He opens the cap and gently pours peach fuzz over her shoulders. 44. 38 38 39 39 40 40 EXT. MANSION - ROAD - NIGHT Ki-Woo has just walked out of the gate when he hears VIOLENT COUGHING from inside. It’s Mun-Kwang. He casually walks down the hill as the coughing echoes throughout the neighborhood, creating a discordant harmony with the MUSIC. INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY Mun-Kwang is on the bench talking on her phone. Still covered in red spots. She’s unaware that -- Ki-Tek is watching her from several feet away. He takes out his phone and snaps a selfie, making sure to include Mun-Kwang in the background. MUN-KWANG (into her phone) It was the worst one I ever had. I was sure I was going to die. No. I’m telling you. No peaches for miles. That’s what I’m saying. It’s driving me nuts! INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY Yon-Kyo carries a bunch of shopping bags out of the department store. Ki-Tek is waiting at the Mercedes. He opens the trunk and puts Yon-Kyo’s bags in. When he’s done, he continues to linger. He hesitates before taking out his phone. KI-TEK Mrs. Park. I, um, I didn’t know if this was worth mentioning, but I wanted to make sure. He shows Yon-Kyo a photo on his phone. KI-TEK (CONT’D) This person behind me. Is that-- YON-KYO What-- Hey, that’s Mun-Kwang! KI-TEK So it was her. I didn’t quite remember her face. I’d only seen her a couple of times when I went up to the house. 45. 41 41 42 42 YON-KYO Where is this from? Is that a hospital? KI-TEK Yes. I was at the hospital the other day for an annual check-up. I was taking a selfie to send my wife when I saw her behind me. Yon-Kyo looks closely at the picture. YON-KYO Looks like she’s talking on the phone. KI-TEK Yes, see-- I didn’t mean to, but I ended up overhearing-- INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) KI-TEK (stammering) I, uh, didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but I happened to be right there, and unfortunately, uh, overheard everything-- KI-WOO Cut, stop right there. Dad, you’re overdoing it. The worrying thing. Tone it down. I can tell you’re acting. Ki-Tek rehearses his ‘scene,’ holding a piece of paper with his lines. KI-WOO (CONT’D) Action! INT. MERCEDES - DRIVING - DAY KI-TEK I really didn’t mean to. I was right there, and I just happened to overhear. YON-KYO (interested) What did you hear? 46. 43 43 44 44 45 45 46 46 Ki-Tek looks at Yon-Kyo through the rearview mirror. He takes a hesitant beat before opening his mouth. KI-TEK I don’t know if I should say-- INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) KI-WOO (acting) I heard her say that she was -- diagnosed with tuberculosis! INT. MERCEDES - DRIVING - DAY YON-KYO (stunned) Tuberculosis! Are you sure? KI-TEK What was it-- “Active pulmonary tuberculosis.” She was talking on the phone, and she seemed very upset. Like she was angry at herself. INT. SEMI-BASEMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) KI-WOO (female voice) I didn’t even know tuberculosis was still a thing. INT. MERCEDES - DRIVING - DAY YON-KYO I didn’t even know tuberculosis was still a thing. KI-TEK Neither did I. I remember years ago we used to buy those seals for Christmas, but I thought it was all over. You should look it up. Korea still has the highest tuberculosis rate among OECD countries. YON-KYO I can’t believe that Mun-Kwang-- (emotional) How could she not tell me? I can’t-- 47. 47 47 48 48 49 49 KI-TEK I wasn’t sure if I should say anything, but I felt like you should know. I mean, she was just going about her business like everything was normal. There are young children in the house. DaSong is only ten. And this woman, with her tuberculosis, is in the kitchen making food and touching the dishes-- YON-KYO Stop! Yon-Kyo goes into a shrieking fit. YON-KYO (CONT’D) Please! No more! INT. MANSION - DA-SONG’S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON The art lesson is in progress. Ki-Jung has Da-Song in her lap. She touches Da-Song’s face with her cheek as she looks at his drawing. Ki-Jung’s cell phone DINGS. It’s a text from Ki-Tek -- “ETA 3 min. Get ready.” INT. MANSION - STAIRS - LATE AFTERNOON SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC builds as Ki-Jung descends the stairs. When she removes her hand from her pocket, we see that it’s covered in soft PEACH FUZZ. The fuzz glistens in the afternoon sunlight as Ki-Jung walks down to the -- KITCHEN Where she opens the fridge and removes a bottle of water. Mun-Kwang comes over and hands her a glass. As Ki-Jung takes the glass, she casually wipes the peach fuzz on Mun-Kwang’s hand."
